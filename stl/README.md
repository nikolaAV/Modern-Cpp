# The New C++ Library Features.
C++ got a lot of additions in C++11, C++14, and, most recently, C++17. 
By now, it is a completely different language compared to what it was just a decade ago. 
The C++ standard does not only standardize the language, as it needs to be understood by the compilers, but also the C++ standard template library (STL).  
Some snippets of codecase in this section explain how to put the STL to the best use with a broad range of examples.
