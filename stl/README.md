# The New C++ Library Features.
C++ got a lot of additions in C++11, C++14, and, most recently, C++17. 
By now, it is a completely different language compared to what it was just a decade ago. 
The C++ standard does not only standardize the language, as it needs to be understood by the compilers, but also the C++ standard template library (STL).  
Some snippets of codecase in this section explain how to put the STL to the best use with a broad range of examples.  
* [`is_transparent` or Heterogeneous Lookup in Ordered Containers](./is_transparent) the ability to search an associative container with a key of type which is different to element type stored in the container.
* [shift](./shift) How to shift elements inside the container?
* [`std::map` update key](./update_map_key) and [swap key](./swap_map_key) how to swap / update element key in the collection very efficiently without memory reallocation.
