# Variatic Templates. A few useful examples

## [Element Enumeration](./enumeration)
It demonstrates several ways how elements in the variadic template construction <...> can be enumerated.

## [Inheritance Generation](./inheritance)
An easy technique to build class hierarchy.

## [Universal Delegate](./universal%20delegate)
A call decorator for any function with various parameters. It allow to customize the call with extra functionality and provides that no overhead.

## [Mixin-based Programming](./mixins)
Applying multiple inheritance to compose a target class as set of different fragments of code.

## [Fold expression (since C++17)](./fold_expressions)
Several examples how to reduce function parameter pack over a binary operator.

## [Variadic Indices](./variadic_indices)
Variadic list of indices to access the corresponding element of the container.

## [Predicate Composition](./predicate_composition)
How to compose more complex type traits based on several primitives.

## [Type Lists](https://github.com/nikolaAV/skeleton/tree/master/type_list)
One of the central data structure in metaprogramming is the typelist, which, as its name implies, is a list containing types.

## [make_curried](../lambda/lambda_currying/main2.cpp)
Generic approach to make from any callable object a curried function `f(a1,a2,a3)`->`f(a1)(a2)(a3)`.
