# C++ 17 [`std::variant`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant) + [`std::visit`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/visit) templates. A few useful examples

* [Heterogeneous Container](./heterogeneous_container)
Is there a possibility to store elements of different types in the same container? 
Yes, it's possible if these types are inclosed by [`std::variant`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant).
* [Multiple Dispatch](./multiple_dispatch) or multi-methods. An easy way how the most appropriate overload can be chosen if the number of parameters more than two.
* [Pattern Matching](./pattern_matching) on type.
